1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Callback Functions
	    Functions that can invoke other functions within them as an argument. You can use the function to create a value to be passed to another function to be invoked.
	
	* Closure
	    Closure is the ability to access a private scope variable outside of a function and it won't be affected from the outside.
	
	* `arguments`
	    The 'arguments' term allows you to generally access an unknown array and perform some modification on it. Not as many options to modify with, as you can't use .push(), .pop(), or most similar terms. Importantly, you can access arguments.length.
	
	* Recursion
	    Having a function invoke itself until it can't anymore by giving it a stopping point by the way of an 'if (...) return' statement.
	
	* `prototype`
	    A prototype is a function that can be invoked on any object created in a certain constructor.
	
	* Constructors
	    Constructors are a way of creating objects to have the same properties and methods.
